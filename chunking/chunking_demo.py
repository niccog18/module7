# A sample "document" — a mini lesson about FastAPI
document = """FastAPI is a modern Python web framework for building APIs. It was created by 
Sebastián Ramírez and released in 2018. FastAPI is built on top of Starlette for the web 
parts and Pydantic for the data parts.

One of FastAPI's biggest advantages is automatic data validation. When you define a Pydantic 
model for your endpoint, FastAPI automatically validates incoming request data. If the data 
doesn't match the model, the client gets a detailed 422 error response.

FastAPI also generates interactive API documentation automatically. Visit /docs for Swagger 
UI or /redoc for ReDoc. The documentation stays in sync with your code because it's 
generated from your type hints and Pydantic models.

Async support is another key feature. FastAPI supports Python's async/await syntax natively. 
This means your API can handle multiple concurrent requests without blocking. When one 
request is waiting for a database query, the server processes other requests.

JWT authentication is commonly used with FastAPI. You create a /auth/token endpoint that 
validates credentials and returns a signed token. Protected endpoints then require a valid 
token in the Authorization header.

Testing FastAPI applications uses pytest with TestClient. You can test endpoints without 
running a server. TestClient simulates HTTP requests and returns the responses for 
assertion."""
